Here we model and simulate. Or simulate and model, depending on what we feel like.

## To do list:
- [x] make the cars start evenly spread across the road
- [x] try out car distributions
- [ ] add logic to the movement of the cars
- [x] implement physics from paper
- [ ] implement a measure of the traffic-jamness of the simulation, try to find relationships between variables and the amount of traffic jam generated
